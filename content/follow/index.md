## Follow using RSS

One way to follow the Horn Journey blog is by using [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). RSS is a news feed that provides users with regularly updated content. You can use a feed reader app on your computer or mobile device to read news feeds from your favorite blogs and news sources. I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), a free and open-source app available for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Other feed reader apps are also available for these platforms and for Windows and Android.

If you have a feed reader app installed on your device, then clicking the RSS icon (![RSS](/image/rss-feed-16.svg)) at the bottom of this and other pages of this site should launch the app and give you the opportunity to subscribe to the Horn Journey news feed.
