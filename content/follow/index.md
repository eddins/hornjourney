One way to follow the Horn Journey blog is by using [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). RSS is a news feed that provides users with regularly updated content. You can use a feed reader app on your computer or mobile device to read news feeds from your favorite blogs and news sources. I use the [Reeder app](https://reederapp.com) on my iPhone. Feed reader apps are available on Mac, Windows, iPhone, and Android.

If you have a feed reader app installed on your device, then clicking the RSS icon (![RSS](/image/rss-feed-16.svg)) at the bottom of this and other pages of this site should launch the app and give you the opportunity to subscribe to the Horn Journey news feed.

Another way to follow the blog is to sign up for the Horn Journey mailing list by filling out the following form.
