## Coming up

[Concord Orchestra](https://www.concordorchestra.com/co/) starts the new season with rehearsal next Tuesday. On the first program (October 14, 15):

- Beethoven, *Coriolan Overture*, Op. 62
- Sibelius, *King Kristian II suite*, Op. 27
- Hanson, Symphony No. 2 (*Romantic*), Op. 30

I'm very excited about having a chance to play Hanson 2, which keeps the horn section busy with rewarding parts in all three movements. This will also be the first season with our new music director, [Zeke Fetrow](https://www.concordorchestra.com/co/zeke-fetrow-photo-bio/). We've been without a regular music director for more than three years.

[Melrose Symphony Orchestra](https://www.melrosesymphony.org) starts its 106<sup>th</sup> (!!) season with the September 11 rehearsal. Its first program (on November 4):

- Berlioz, *Roman Carnival Overture*, Op. 9
- Chopin, Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21
- Mussorgsky (orch. Ravel), *Pictures at an Exhibition*

## Website tweaks

I ditched the contact form. Instead, you can just email me directly using the link at the bottom of each post.

I'm also going to kill the Facebook *Horn Journey* page in about a week. I'm not too happy about that experiment. Facebook's page admin interface is just too obnoxious and pushy about doing things like paying to promote the page. If you want to follow the blog using Facebook, just follow my [personal page](https://www.facebook.com/steve.eddins.399/).
