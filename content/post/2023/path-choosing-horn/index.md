How did you choose to play horn? I don't know whether it's really true, but I have the impression that horn players have unusually strange stories about how they chose to play the instrument. For me, it happened in Spanish class.

In elementary school and early high school, my only experience with a musical instrument was a few months of guitar lessons in the 6th grade, during which I managed to learn exactly nothing about music. Then came second-year Spanish class in the 10th grade.

I had a huge crush on a girl in the class. She was a grade older, and we sat next to each other and talked. She played oboe in the school band and violin in the orchestra. At some point during the fall quarter, she talked me into going to see the band director about joining band. To her, the fact that I didn't play an instrument was not an obstacle. She said to tell the director that I wanted to play something called the "French horn."

I didn't know what that was, but completely besotted, I agreed to this plan -- and it worked out surprisingly well! Like many high schools, mine was always short on French horn players, so the director asked no questions. He found a battered horn case from the depths of the band closet, gave it to me, and told me to sign up for the concert band class for the winter quarter, starting in January. His wife, as it turned out, studied French horn at FSU, and so I started taking lessons with her, using Rubank method books. And I practiced. From the very beginning, I always liked to practice.

A couple of months later, I was sitting in the band room next to Robert, the first horn, and the only high school friend I have stayed in touch with. I vaguely recall lots of struggling to figure out what note I was playing.

To answer the question I usually hear when I tell this story -- no, I have no idea whatever happened to the girl from my Spanish class.
