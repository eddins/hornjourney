Last month, I spent about three weeks playing lines from Clarke's First Study every day.

There are 25 lines written out in this study, with the last line topping out at high C ([C<sub>6</sub>](https://www.hornjourney.com/post/2023/09/23/horn-call-octave-designation-notation/)).

I play the lines at about dotted half note = 50, very softly, and with about 4 repeats in one breath.

I picked this exercise with several improvement goals in mind.

## Keeping fingers on the keys

I have a strong tendency to let my fingers fly off the keys, an excessive motion that (as Hazel often points out) slows things down and makes valve timing more difficult. I don't really need to look at the page while playing this, so I can instead observe my fingers and see how they are moving in the transitions from note to note.

## Avoiding tension in hand and wrist

I also tend to accumulate a lot of hand and wrist tension when I play a long set of valve movements. This causes me to tire and be unable to maintain the tempo. This exercise definitely makes it obvious if that is happening!

## Smoothing out some trouble spots

I have trouble with note transitions at around G<sub>4</sub>, A<sup>♭</sup><sub>4</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, and B<sup>♭</sup><sub>4</sub>. Using traditional fingerings, these involve multiple thumb and finger combinations, which I struggle to do without extra wrist movement that causes the horn to move around on my face. There is also the the air resistance change when going between the F and B<sup>♭</sup> horns. Because of these issues, my note transitions in this region are often a bit choppy, and sometimes the tempo is not completely steady.

## Early results

I noticed improvements in all these areas within about two weeks of daily practice. I can now keep my fingers on the keys, except for a bit of remaining fly-away with finger 3.

When I first started, wrist and hand tension caused me to tire after only 7 or 8 lines, and now I'm able to stay tension-free and am no longer limited by that.

It took longer, but I'm start to see smoother note transitions in my trouble area as well.

## What to do next

It takes a long time to work through this entire set, and there are lots of other things (such as orchestra parts!) that I need to be working on. I've already stopped trying to do the entire set every day. One possibility is to do just a few lines a day, concentrating on different ranges.

Another idea is to add the top octave of lines to my set of high-range exercises.

Certainly, if I notice finger issues or hand tension again, I can come back to this study for a refresher.
