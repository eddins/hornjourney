For the past couple of months, I've been working on arpeggios using an exercise based on Maddy Tarantelli's article in the May 2023 *Horn Call*, "Integrating Theory into Fundamentals of Horn Playing."

In this slight revision, I have inserted dotted quarter notes into the exercise (measures 2 and 4) to give myself places to breathe. I have also arranged the keys in the circle of fifths (in the direction of adding flats) instead of ascending in chromatic steps as shown in the article.

There are several things I'm trying to pay attention to as I work through all the major keys:

- Playing the exercise musically, experimenting with dynamics, time, and color. At a minimum, I need to stay out of the note-at-a-time trap. I've been trying different ways to emphasize measure 5, where the chords take a sudden left turn, by playing it louder, or with accents, or by changing the tone color.
- Playing accurately. There are a lot of different intervals in this exercise, and I must hear them accurately, in the moment, in order to play them all accurately.
- In the final measure, playing the high notes (as high as C<sub>6</sub>) in the F major pattern) with a clear, easy tone. This has been challenging, and I'm still working on it.
- Playing the final octave intervals in tune, especially the final low note, where I have a tendency to come in flat.
