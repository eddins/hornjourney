## In rehearsal

The season is over for my regular orchestras, and I have no rehearsals scheduled until late July.

## Coming up

I just got a job playing with the [Claflin Hill Symphony Summer Winds](https://www.claflinhill.com/summer-series) for four performances in late July and August. I haven't seen the book yet.

The Melrose Symphony and Concord Orchestra seasons will start just after Labor Day.

My wife and I are taking a long-ish vacation later this month. I won't be able to take my horn, but I'll have my mouthpiece!

## On the stand
