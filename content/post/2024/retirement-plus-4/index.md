Today is the fourth day since my retirement from MathWorks, after working there for 30+ years. The last month or so was rather intense. I had lengthy conversations with many people, and I had long lists of things I wanted to get done before my last day. As a result, my horn practice was more disrupted in March than at any other time in the past 8 years or so. It bothered me, but I just had to let go of worrying about it.

My horn recovery effort began on Saturday. I have practiced 2-3 hours per day since then. My routine so far has been to practice two sessions in the morning, with some exercise in between. Then, if I don't have a rehearsal in the evening, I practice once more later in the day. I'm sure this will evolve as I get accustomed to my new schedule.

This seems like a good to take a look at everything I need to play in the next couple of months so that I don't caught unprepared.
