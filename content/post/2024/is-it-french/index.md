My [previous post](https://www.hornjourney.com/post/2024/04/25/thinking-about-amateur/) was about a tricky terminology issue (regarding the word "amateur"), and today I want to follow up about another sometimes controversial phrase: *French horn*

My American readers and friends who are not orchestral insiders are all thinking this right now:

> Controversy? What controversy?? Isn't it called a French horn???

In the past, the term French horn was widely used in the U.S., both among musicians and the general public. Here are some older publications demonstrating this practice:

Beginning in 1971, though, the [International Horn Society](https://hornsociety.org)  declared that the instrument should be called a horn, not a French horn. (Being only seven at the time, I paid no attention.) The reasoning was that our modern instrument is not really of French origin, and therefore the term French horn is inappropriate.

More than 50 years since that decision, how's it going?

It depends.

The community of U.S. horn players, as far as I can tell, is comfortable using the term horn.

- Partial success
- Total failure

Starting with the partial success

Let’s see what the 2020 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary has to say about it. Here’s the dictionary definition of French horn:  

Now compare that with the definition of horn (I added the thumbnail illustrations):

While the IHS terminology has affected usage within the specialized area of orchestral music, it has evidently had no impact on broader usage, at least in American English. There are two reasons for this failure:

There was already a term, French horn, in widespread cultural use for the instrument.
The new term, horn, was already widely established with multiple meanings that conflicted with or could be confused with the IHS usage.
For naming things, this was basically a worst-case scenario. The new terminology had no chance.

There is still the argument, made by some French horn players, that it is incorrect to use the term French horn because it is a misnomer. Once upon a time, the instruments were of French origin, but the modern instrument is not.

But everyday, common English language is filled with misnomers that result from older terms being retained, even though they no longer apply. Here are some examples:

Pencil lead is no longer made of lead.
Chalk is no longer made of chalk.
Phone numbers are still dialed, although phones no longer have a dial.
In golf, woods that are made of metal are still called woods.

Here are a few other fun misnomers in widespread use:

Koala bears are not bears.
Jellyfish are not fish.
Strawberries are not berries.
Chinese checkers did not originate in China.
Dry cleaning involves the use of liquid solvents.
When I’m speaking to people who are entirely within the circle of experienced orchestral musicians, horn is sufficient to be understood, and that’s what I often use.

For any broader group of people, however, I use French horn, in the interest of clear communication.

with another wording conundrum. teaching other software developers how to name things (in programming interfaces) was a significant part of my MathWorks career. MathWorks is filled with engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians who are generally used to the idea of adapting ordinary English terms to highly specialized meanings. Every now and then, I have to caution the developers not to use a term in a way that conflicts with the ordinary English usage of that term.

What have people done in practice? Most people make practical choices, with an eye towards effective communication that is unambiguous and avoids misunderstanding. They've been practical.
