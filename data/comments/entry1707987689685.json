There are many tunes to play and they go quite fast. So I've had to force myself to practice with the main aim of keeping tempo and not stopping. Mistakes will always happen, so I need to learn the skills to deal with that and keep tempo and rhythm going while I find a way to recover, all the while making sure the dancers can keep dancing. Interestingly, I've recently decided I'm doing that too much and I would benefit from slowing down my practice and being more methodical so I can get the correct fingerings in my muscle memory, but it's really useful that I've built up the skill of being able to plough on regardless of any mistakes I'm making.","date":"2024-02-15T09:01:29.684Z"}
